## Getting Started

Using your Command Line Terminal Interface, navigate to the /src folder and execute the meal_assistant_main.rb file using the following command: 

```
$ ruby meal_assistant_main.rb
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following Gem Package using your Command Line Terminal Interface: 

```
$ gem install tty
```


## Concept
An app to: 
- 'Organise My Own Weekly Meal Plan'
- 'Generate a Shopping List'

Ethical considerations/societal impact:
- app is not currently using publicly available data
- no senstiive, unique or personal information is being collected from users or used in app
= therefore, minimal negative risk of societal impact


## Functionality
Outcomes for MVP:
- take user input
- user can create custom ingredients
- user can create custom meals
- user can generate a weekly "calendar style" meal plan
- user can generate a shopping list of ingredients required for their meal plan
  
Outside MVP if time: 
- user can edit saved ingredients and meals
- user can delete saved ingredients and meals
- alphabeticalise printed shopping list
- categorise printed shopping list into supermarket categories (ie: dairy, meat, fresh produce)
- organise 


## Project Plan & Timeline
The scope for the Meal Assistant App MVP build was two days.

Day 1 tasks and time were mostly spent on refining the overall concept, functionality and features to a scope that was deliverable within the allowed project timeframe. Once the app architecture and development plan was outline on paper and tasks allocated in Trello, coding began immediately.

Day 2 tasks and time were mostly spent coding necessary modules, classes and methods and investigating how to incorporate the TTY Table Gem to print to screen the Meal and Weekly Plan table.

### Challenges
- The TTY Table Gen was definitely a challenge to incorporate into the app. The Gem's documentation was unclear and in some cases did not actually work as described.
- Choosing which functions to scale back to a minimum (due to time restraints) also left the app without certain functionality such as the user being able to edit and delete Ingredients and Meals.
